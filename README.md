# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. In this project, I compiled reviews from Amazonâ€™s outdoor products to determine whether Vine members entered more favorable reviews. For the ETL process I used PySpark to extract and transform the data, connected it to an AWS RDS instance, and loaded the transformed data into pgAdmin. Then I used pandas to analyze the reviews. 

## Results

Before doing any analysis, I filtered out all the reviews that did not get at least 20 votes. After filtering the data, there were 107 Vine reviews and 39869 non-Vine reviews.
