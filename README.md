# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. In this project, I compiled reviews from Amazonâ€™s outdoor products to determine whether Vine members entered more favorable reviews. For the ETL process I used PySpark to extract and transform the data, connected it to an AWS RDS instance, and loaded the transformed data into pgAdmin. Then I used pandas to analyze the reviews. 

## Results

Before doing any analysis, I filtered out all the reviews that did not get at least 20 votes.

## Summary

Overall, Vine reviews showed a bias. Out of all of the 5 star reviews, Vine reviews accounted for 89% of them while non-Vine reviews accounted for the remaining 11 percent. This suggests that people who purchase the product are more likely to rate a purchase more favorably than one who has not purchased the product.
